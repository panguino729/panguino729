<div class="about"><span><p>The Trial: Choices starts at the entrance to The Trial. You must survive the various traps and encounters while traversing through the maze. Along the way, you can find documents and clues that hint at the lost history of Stemvia. By gathering all of the lost information, you will have to make a choice at the end of the maze. You will have to choose between leaving and joining society, or staying and joining the Resistance. Each decision will have consequences, so you must choose carefully.</p></span></div>
